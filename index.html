		  				<p> I currently live in New York and have lived on the Upper East Side for five years. One thing that may not seem too obvious is that playing the guitar and singing has been a hobby of mine for ten years, and all started with my love of the Beatles. I learned piano at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, which is where I am originally from, and started to play the guitar with help from teachers both during college and through private lessons. 
						Besides music, I love to play soccer and am currently a player for the Beyond Football Club in New York. I learned how to play throughout the past year, since I started with the club. I also played recreationally growing up and played with a South American team in Toronto when I was younger. I donâ€™t watch the English Premier League too much but my favorite team currently is Chelsea and my favorite player is Ricardo Kaka. I like to also play basketball and play pick up at the 92 Y on the Upper East Side.
